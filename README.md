**** What is Bootstrap? ****
Bootstrap is a free, open source front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. 
Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of syntax for template designs.

The Bootstrap framework is built on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. 
Web developers using Bootstrap can build websites much faster without spending time worrying about basic commands and functions.
Bootstrap is more than efficient to create a responsive and mobile first website but it is not the best in the industry. There is an alternative of Bootstrap named W3.CSS which is smaller, faster, and easier to use.
